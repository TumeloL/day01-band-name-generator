#This program takes 2 variables that the user will give and combine those 2 inputs to make a band name!
#LOL original right?

print("Welcome to the band generator\n") # Greets the user and adds a newline for spacing

city_name=input("What is the name of your city?\n") # Gets city input from user

pet_name=input("What is the name of your favourite pet?\n") # Gets pet name input from user

# Combines the two inputs with a space and prints it as a band name
print("CONGRATULATIONS YOUR NEW BAND NAME IS "+city_name+" "+pet_name+"!")
