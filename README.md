# day01-band-name-generator
Day 1 of the 100 Days of Python: A simple band name generator that takes user input and combines it creatively.

Welcome to my Day 1 project from the [100 Days of Code - Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/)!  
This simple but fun program helps generate a fictional band name based on the user's input.

## üöÄ What This Program Does

This Python script:
- Greets the user.
- Asks for their **city name**.
- Asks for the name of their **favorite pet**.
- Combines both inputs to generate a custom **band name**.

## ‚úÖ What I Learned
- How to get input from users using input().
- How to display messages using print().
- How to combine strings using +.
- How to write clean and readable code with comments.
- The importance of spacing and formatting in output.


## To run this project:
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Open a terminal or IDE.
3. Run the script
